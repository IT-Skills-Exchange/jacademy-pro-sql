## SQL

Welcome to the chapter on SQL! SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful language used for managing and manipulating
relational databases. In this chapter, we will explore SQL's fundamentals, equipping you with the skills to interact
with databases and work with data effectively.
Understanding SQL is crucial for software developers and data professionals. Throughout this chapter, we will cover
topics such as creating and querying tables, data manipulation, joins, aggregations, and subqueries.
By mastering these concepts, you will be able to write complex queries and extract valuable insights from your data.

In addition to theory, we will provide practical examples and best practices for efficient and reliable database management.
By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid foundation in SQL and be ready to work with databases proficiently.

Get ready to dive into the world of SQL and discover how it can transform your data management skills.
Let's explore SQL together and unleash the power of relational databases!
